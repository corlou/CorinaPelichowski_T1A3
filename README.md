## Welcome to the Tarot Reader Terminal App

Tarot is expensive and difficult to find so this terminal app will give you free card readings whenever you are in the need for some guidance.

# How to Install the App:

# When the App is running:

When you run the app, select from the following options:

1. Get a history of you readings
2. Get a new reading
3. Get a "Card of the Day"
4. Get your star sign and element
5. Quit

Please note, when selecting Option 4: Star Sign, you will need to type the day as a number, press Enter, then type your month as a number, and press enter to reveal your star sign. For example: 31st October will be 31 + enter + 10 + enter which will reveal "Sco Water" which is Scorpio and the element is Water.
