## R5 Code Style

PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code has been utilised.
Some examples include (but not limited to):

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- The closing bracket on multiline constructs may either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list, or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that starts the multiline construct. See deck.py for example.
- Imports are listed with Standard library imports first and then Related third party imports second.
- Comments should be complete sentences. The first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).

NOTE:

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling
  A user will enter a number between 1 and 5 which will return one of the following:

1. Get a history of tarot readings = This will work after a user has done one or more readings
2. Get a new reading = This will return three random cards from the card list
3. Get a "Card of the Day" = This will select one random card from the card list and return it
4. Star Sign Information = This requires two integer inputs (day and month) which will return a star sign and the element
5. Quit = This stops the app

## R7 Implementation Plan

## R8 Instructions for Installation

### When the App is running:

When you run the app, select from the following options:

1. Get a history of you readings
2. Get a new reading
3. Get a "Card of the Day"
4. Get your star sign and element
5. Quit

Please note, when selecting Option 4: Star Sign, you will need to type the day as a number, press Enter, then type your month as a number, and press Enter to reveal your star sign. For example: 31st October will be 31 + enter + 10 + enter which will reveal "Sco Water" which is Scorpio and the element is Water.
